# Edgerouter X - Letsencrypt certificate creation and installation

Here are my notes on how to get a Letsencrypt certificate installed on an Edgerouter X devices.
*** Important ***
This setup is manual and will not automatically renew the certificate.
My domain registrar does not support DNS API

You will need:
1. A registered domain - I use hover.com
2. SSH access to your Edgerouter
